# ARG001: ParameterCollection must be partial

## Summary
Classes that use the `ParameterCollection` attribute must be declared as `partial` classes.

## Cause
This error occurs when you apply the `ParameterCollection` attribute to a class that is not declared as `partial`.

The ArgumentParser generator needs to add the `Parse` method to your class, which requires the class to be declared as `partial`.

## How to fix
Add the `partial` modifier to your class declaration:

```csharp
[ParameterCollection]
public partial class MyCommandLineArguments
{
    // Properties with Option, Flag, and Positional attributes
}
```
